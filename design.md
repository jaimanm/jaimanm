# Design Philosophy

## Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Deep Space Navy: #0B1426 (main background)
- Quantum Silver: #E8EDF5 (primary text)
- IonQ Teal: #2DD4BF (accent color, inspired by your work with IonQ)
- Plasma Purple: #8B5CF6 (secondary accent for quantum elements)

**Supporting Colors:**
- Matrix Green: #10B981 (success states, GitHub contributions)
- Warm Amber: #F59E0B (highlights, call-to-action elements)

## Typography
**Display Font:** Canela Text (bold serif for headings)
- Used for: Main headings, hero text, section titles
- Conveys: Sophistication, technical authority, academic rigor

**Body Font:** Neue Haas Grotesk (neutral sans-serif)
- Used for: Body text, navigation, project descriptions
- Conveys: Clarity, modernity, technical precision

**Code Font:** JetBrains Mono
- Used for: Code snippets, technical details

## Visual Language
**Quantum Aesthetic:** Clean, precise geometric forms inspired by quantum circuit diagrams and Bloch spheres. Visual elements reference superposition states through overlapping translucent layers.

**Professional Tech:** Maintains credibility through structured layouts and sophisticated color choices, avoiding overly playful elements while remaining engaging.

**Interactive Sophistication:** Subtle animations that feel responsive and purposeful, never distracting from content. Physics-based motion that reflects your quantum computing background.

## Visual Effects

### Used Libraries:
1. **Anime.js** - Smooth quantum gate animations and state transitions
2. **p5.js** - Real-time quantum state visualizations and particle systems
3. **ECharts.js** - Interactive radar charts for project complexity analysis
4. **Pixi.js** - High-performance quantum circuit rendering
5. **Typed.js** - Typewriter effect for hero section
6. **Splitting.js** - Letter-by-letter text animations
7. **Splide.js** - Smooth project carousel with quantum-inspired transitions
8. **Shader-park** - Background quantum field effects

### Effect Implementation:

**Background Effects:**
- Subtle quantum field simulation using particle systems
- Interference patterns that respond to mouse movement
- Bloch sphere rotations in the background

**Text Effects:**
- Typewriter animation for main heading with quantum gate symbols
- Letter-by-letter stagger animations on section reveals
- Color cycling emphasis on key technical terms

**Interactive Elements:**
- Quantum gate hover effects with state superposition visualizations
- Smooth morphing between project filter states
- 3D tilt effects on project cards with depth shadows
- Ripple effects on button clicks

**Scroll Motion:**
- Subtle fade-in animations (max 20px vertical translation)
- Staggered reveals for project grids
- Parallax on decorative quantum elements only
- All content visible by default, animations enhance but don't hide

### Header Effect:
Quantum circuit diagram that subtly animates based on scroll position, with qubit lines that pulse and gates that highlight as user explores different sections. The circuit represents actual quantum algorithms you've worked with.

### Styling Approach:
- Consistent use of translucent overlays to suggest quantum superposition
- Geometric shapes inspired by quantum computing notation
- Subtle gradients that never exceed 50% saturation
- High contrast text (4.5:1 minimum) for accessibility
- Responsive design optimized for high-resolution displays

### Quantum-Inspired Elements:
- Navigation tabs styled as quantum measurement devices
- Project cards with entanglement-inspired connecting lines
- Skill bars that animate like quantum probability amplitudes
- Achievement badges designed as quantum circuit components
